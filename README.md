| main.py       | Main file that handles the login and sending connection request functionality.|
| mouseclick.py | Utility script used to record the coordinates of specific points on the screen.|

## Why mouseclick.py?
The `mouseclick.py` script is included to address potential issues that may arise due to different screen sizes. By running `mouseclick.py`, you can obtain the coordinates of specific points on your screen. These coordinates can be used to accurately interact with elements on the LinkedIn page, such as buttons and sliders. The script records the coordinates when the right mouse button is clicked.

## Usage
1. Run the `main.py` file to initiate the LinkedInConnectBot.
2. The bot will automate the process of sending connection requests on LinkedIn.

## Future Features (Upcoming Enhancements)
LinkedInConnectBot has the potential to incorporate several features to further improve the user experience. Some possible features include:

- Personalized Message Templates: Allow users to create customized connection request messages for better engagement.
- Intelligent Targeting: Implement advanced algorithms to identify and connect with relevant professionals based on specific criteria.
- Connection Status Tracking: Track the status of sent connection requests to provide insights into accepted, pending, or rejected requests.
- Anti-Spam Measures: Implement measures to prevent the bot from triggering spam filters on LinkedIn.
- Error Handling and Logging: Enhance the error handling mechanism and implement a logging system for better debugging.

These features aim to enhance the functionality and user experience of LinkedInConnectBot.
